The main purpose of this blog is to document my attempts to find ways
of using my nerd powers for good. More specifically, I want to find ways
of using what I have learned in my time as a data scientist to help
fight for social justice issues. I have a few ideas of how I might go
about doing that and I want to start exploring those ideas here. For
more information about why I started this blog, check out my

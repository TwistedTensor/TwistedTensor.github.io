I’msure things will change as I continue to work on this and what Iactually end up doing may look very different, but I have startsomewhere.As a data scientist, I am very concerned about how big data and machinelearning are used to reinforce institutional and interpersonal oppression.Algorithms written by people like me are making decisions that controlwho should or shouldn’t be approved for loans and credit cards, whatcontent to recommend to bigots, what posts should be flagged forinappropriate content, and so much more. I want to find ways that thissame technology could be used to fight oppression rather than uphold it.This is something I’ve been thinking about for a while and I have a lotof ideas, some small, some big, on ways to use data for good. My goalfor the new year is to start actually trying to explore these ideas andshare my journey here. I am interested in any sort of social justicerelated issues, but I will probably start with trans stuff because, well,I’m trans.BrainstormingStudying the spread of transphobic ideasThis is probably the most ambitious project I’ve been thinking of. I wouldwant to study how transphobic ideas spread from institutions, in the formof academic research and news articles, to the general public. The idea wouldbe to start with something like rapid onset gender dysphoria, look at the variousarticles have been published about it, and then look at things like tweetsand reddit posts referencing those articles. The text from all of these can bescraped and analyzed to get some sense of the impact transphobic articles haveon the online discourse.Making information on trans healthcare more accessibleWhile there have been a lot of advances in trans healthcare in recent years,there is still not enough research being done on the subject and the researchthat is being done is not widely known in the medical community. Because ofthis, trans people often have to do their own research in order to make informeddecisions about their healthcare. In my day job I scrape data from medicalresearch papers to create a knowledge base centered around cancer treatments.I would like to try to do something similar for trans healthcare research, butwith a focus on generating easy to read summaries of the key findings of the research so that trans people don’t have to wade through pages of medical jargonto understand it.Why is breadtube so white?Many people have pointed out that the vast majority of popular leftist politicalchannels on youtube tend to center cishet white men. While a lot of this islikely due to consious or unconsious biases in the way people consume contentand the way creators network with each other, it has also been suggested thatthe youtube algorithm itself tends to reinforce this through it’s recommendations.I don’t know exactly how I could go about studying this phenomena since obviouslythe youtube api isn’t going to let me pull any information about what videos arebeing recommended to users, but I wonder if I might be able to find indirectevidence of this by scraping the comments section. If a lot of people who commenton youtuber A’s videos also comment on youtuber B’s videos, there is a good chancethat youtube is recommending youtuber A’s content to youtuber B’s audience and viceversa.Toxic fanbasesOne pattern that tends to repeat over and over online is people with a large social media following using their followers to attack others online. Itwould be interesting to use something like the pagerank algorithm to seewhich influencers are the most toxic based on how toxic the people that followthem are and how toxic the followers of their followers are etc." } ]
